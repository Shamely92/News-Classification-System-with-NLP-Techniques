# News-Classification-System-with-NLP-Techniques

**Overview**
This project involves building an automated news classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system extracts news articles, preprocesses the data, applies clustering algorithms, and trains a machine learning model to predict the topics of news articles.

**Project Flow**
The project is structured as follows:

**web_scraping:** Contains scripts for web scraping to extract news articles.
**data_processing:** Includes scripts for cleaning and preprocessing the extracted data.
**clustering:** Implements topic clustering algorithms on preprocessed text data.
**classification:** Involves training a supervised machine learning model for news topic classification.
**streamlit_app:** Houses the Streamlit application for interactive classification.
